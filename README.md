# Personal data projects
__Project Purpose:__We used data from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect (NDACAN) 2019, which includes all children in foster care in 2019. The NDACAN data have been provided by the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect, which is housed at Cornell University and overseen by Children Bureau. The data have been de-identified prior to being made available to researchers in the publicly available version of the data, which are the data we used for all analyses. The NDACAN data contains case-level information on all children in foster care for whom State and Tribal title IV-E agencies have responsibility for placement, care or supervision, and on children who are adopted under the auspices of the State and Tribal title IV-E agency'. Title IV-E agencies are required to submit NDACAN data semi-annually to the Children Bureau.

The goal of using this data is to find association between the a few of the selected categories variables in anaylzing, performing, and creating visualization to explain differences, similaries, and discovering new informatiom for NDACAN.
- __Tools used:__ Provide an overview of the programming languages and packages you leveraged for this work.  You could provide links to the pertinent reading material that you leveraged to complete the job. Provide links to your final scripts stored in your repository.
- __Results:__ This is your conclusion.  Explain why your work matters.  How could others use it?  What are your next steps? Show some key findings.

## Writing about data science

[Thusan's article on how writing about data science is not easy](https://towardsdatascience.com/lets-admit-it-writing-about-data-science-is-not-easy-37a376777d36) could be helpful as you document your project and skills.

## Data sources

You don't need to make these projects complicated. These projects are built to show your work using the skills you have developed during the course. I would make sure that these are presentable in your Github space. You want to demonstrate your creativity. You could use the following links to find a new data set.

## Github pages

It would help if you took the time to publish your repo for easier viewing of the files.  Please follow the directions at [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to build your pages footprint on the internet.

## Questions

### Is the expectation of our personal projects similar to that of the class projects we are completing?

Yes & No. Here are a few points to highlight the comparison

1. Three different data sets is the main criteria. Hopefully different challenges to your skills and the data can be in the same area for all three if you desire.
2. You can choose the language. Please choose based on where you want employment.
3. We don't get much into the story telling with our class projects.  But, I would hope you tell a story that includes some graphs and analysis.
4. Think of these as sales pitches for future employment. Your personal projects should be in your own Github space.
